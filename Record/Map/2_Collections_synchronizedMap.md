Good catch, Saurabh 👍
This is a **very common confusion in interviews**.

Let’s clear it **cleanly and practically**.

# 🔐 “Synchronized ConcurrentHashMap” – What does it actually mean?

👉 **There is NO class called `SynchronizedConcurrentHashMap`** in Java.

What people usually mean is **one of these two things**:

1. `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())`
2. `ConcurrentHashMap`

They sound similar, but **they work VERY differently**.

---

## 1️⃣ `Collections.synchronizedMap(...)`

### ✔ What it does

It takes a **normal Map** (HashMap / TreeMap / LinkedHashMap)
and wraps it with **method-level synchronization**.

```java
Map<Integer, String> map =
    Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
```

### ✔ How synchronization works

* **Single lock on entire map**
* Only **ONE thread** can access map at a time

### ✔ Null support

Depends on underlying map:

* HashMap → 1 null key, multiple null values
* TreeMap → null key ❌

### ✔ Thread Safe?

✅ YES

### ❌ Performance

🐢 **Slow under high concurrency**

### ❗ Important Catch (Interview favorite)

Iteration is **NOT thread-safe by default**:

```java
synchronized (map) {
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> e : map.entrySet()) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ `ConcurrentHashMap` (Preferred)

```java
Map<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

### ✔ How synchronization works

* **Segment / bucket-level locking**
* Multiple threads can read/write **simultaneously**

### ✔ Null support

❌ No null key
❌ No null value

### ✔ Thread Safe?

✅ YES (Highly scalable)

### ✔ Iteration

* **Weakly consistent**
* No `ConcurrentModificationException`
* No need for external synchronization

## 3️⃣ Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature     | synchronizedMap    | ConcurrentHashMap      |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Locking     | Whole map          | Bucket / segment       |
| Concurrency | Low                | High                   |
| Performance | Slow               | Fast                   |
| Iteration   | Manual sync needed | Safe without sync      |
| Null key    | Depends            | ❌                      |
| Null value  | Depends            | ❌                      |
| Fail-fast   | Yes                | No (weakly consistent) |

## 4️⃣ Why ConcurrentHashMap does NOT allow nulls? (Interview Gold ⭐)

Because:

* `null` is used to **indicate absence of key**
* In concurrent access, ambiguity arises:

    * Is `null` returned because:

        * key not present?
        * value is actually null?
* To **avoid race-condition confusion**, nulls are disallowed

---

## 5️⃣ When to use WHAT?

### ✔ Use `Collections.synchronizedMap` when:

* Low concurrency
* Legacy code
* Need null keys/values
* Simple thread safety

### ✔ Use `ConcurrentHashMap` when:

* High traffic
* Multi-threaded apps
* Spring Boot / Microservices
* Performance matters

👉 **99% of modern applications use `ConcurrentHashMap`**

## 6️⃣ Interview One-Liner Answers

💬 **Q:** Is synchronizedMap same as ConcurrentHashMap?
✅ **A:** No. synchronizedMap uses single lock; ConcurrentHashMap uses fine-grained locking.

💬 **Q:** Which is better?
✅ **A:** ConcurrentHashMap for multi-threaded environments.

💬 **Q:** Can ConcurrentHashMap store null?
❌ **A:** No, to avoid ambiguity in concurrent operations.

## 🔥 Final Verdict

> **“synchronized HashMap ≠ ConcurrentHashMap”**
> Thread-safe ≠ Scalable
