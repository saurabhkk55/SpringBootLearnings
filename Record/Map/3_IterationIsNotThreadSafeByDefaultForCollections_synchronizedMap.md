Excellent question, Saurabh 👌
This shows you’re thinking **beyond definitions** and into **actual behavior**—exactly what interviewers look for.

Let’s break this **slowly, logically, and with a clear “why”**.

---

## 1️⃣ What `Collections.synchronizedMap()` actually synchronizes

```java
Map<K, V> map =
    Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
```

👉 This **synchronizes individual method calls** like:

* `put()`
* `get()`
* `remove()`
* `size()`

**Each method acquires the same lock (`map` object).**

So for **single operations**, thread safety is guaranteed.

---

## 2️⃣ Why iteration is different

### Iteration is **NOT a single method call**

When you do this:

```java
for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> e : map.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println(e);
}
```

Internally, this is happening:

1. `map.entrySet()` → synchronized ✔
2. `iterator()` → synchronized ✔
3. `hasNext()` → ❌ NOT synchronized
4. `next()` → ❌ NOT synchronized

👉 **Only the initial calls are synchronized**,
but the **iteration steps are not**.

---

## 3️⃣ What can go wrong? (Real problem)

While **Thread-A** is iterating:

* **Thread-B** can modify the map (`put/remove`)
* This causes **ConcurrentModificationException**

### Example

```java
Map<Integer, String> map =
    Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

map.put(1, "A");
map.put(2, "B");

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
        System.out.println(key);
    }
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
    map.put(3, "C");
});

t1.start();
t2.start();  // 💥 CME possible
```

## 4️⃣ Correct way to iterate synchronizedMap ✅

Java documentation **explicitly says**:

> *“It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned map when iterating.”*

### ✔ Correct Pattern

```java
synchronized (map) {
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> e : map.entrySet()) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

Now:

* Whole iteration holds the same lock
* No other thread can modify the map
* Safe iteration ✔

---

## 5️⃣ Why Java designed it this way?

Because:

* Synchronizing **every iterator operation** would be:

    * Extremely slow
    * Overly restrictive
* Java gives **control to the developer**

    * You decide when full-lock iteration is required

---

## 6️⃣ Why ConcurrentHashMap does NOT have this problem

```java
Map<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

* Iterators are **weakly consistent**
* They:

    * Don’t throw `ConcurrentModificationException`
    * Can see some updates while iterating
* **No external synchronization needed**

---

## 7️⃣ Key Difference in ONE Table

| Feature       | synchronizedMap      | ConcurrentHashMap |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Method calls  | Thread-safe          | Thread-safe       |
| Iteration     | ❌ Manual sync needed | ✅ Safe            |
| Iterator type | Fail-fast            | Weakly consistent |
| Performance   | Low                  | High              |

## 8️⃣ Interview-Perfect streams.One-Liner 💯

> **“Collections.synchronizedMap synchronizes individual operations, not compound actions like iteration, so external synchronization is required during iteration.”**

---

## 🔥 Final Mental Model (Remember This)

* `synchronizedMap` → **Thread-safe methods**
* Iteration → **Compound operation**
* Compound operations → **Need external lock**

If you want, next we can cover:

* 🔹 Fail-fast vs weakly consistent iterators
* 🔹 Real-world Spring Boot concurrency examples
* 🔹 Why HashMap breaks in multithreading

Just tell me 👍
